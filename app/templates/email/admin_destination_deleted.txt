Hello {{ person['name'] }},

Unfortunately, the carpool at {{ carpool['leave_time'] | humanize }} from {{ carpool['from_place'] }} to {{ destination['name'] }} has been cancelled because the campaign decided to not hold an event at that location.

Please contact the campaign for more information.

{% if person['id'] == carpool['driver_id'] %}
You are the driver of that carpool.
{% endif %}

Other locations my need your help. To help another campaign by being a driver to an event, please visit {{url_for('carpool.find', _external=True)}}

Thank you,

Nomad & the campaign
