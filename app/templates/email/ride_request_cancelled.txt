Hi {{ carpool.driver.name }},

We wanted to let you know that {{ rider.name }} has cancelled their request to ride with you from {{ carpool.from_place }} to {{ carpool.destination.name }} at {{ carpool.leave_time | humanize }}.

Details about this carpool: {{ url_for('carpool.details', uuid=carpool.uuid, _external=True) }}

Thanks!

P.S. If you're having trouble getting riders, make sure your local progressive organizations and party know about Nomad and are sending volunteers to use it!
