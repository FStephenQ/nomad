Hi {{ rider['name'] }}!

Thank you for carpooling to canvass at {{ carpool['destination']['name'] }}. Your carpool's departure time is {{ carpool['leave_time'] | humanize }}, only two days away!

Make sure you have spoken to your driver to confirm your ride and settle all the details of pickup and drop-off. Your driver's email is DRIVER_EMAIL and their phone number is DRIVER_PHONE.

You can use <a href="{{ url_for('carpool.details', uuid=carpool['uuid'], _external=True) }}">this link</a> if you need to withdraw from the carpool. If you do withdraw, please try to do so early enough that other volunteers get a chance to join the carpool and the driver can make any changes they need to.

You are doing great work, thank you for getting a ride to canvass!

SAFETY TIPS
• Have a live phone conversation with your driver before the pickup
• Check out your driver’s social media profile(s)
• Make sure a friend or family member knows where you’re going and with who; check in with them at stages of your trip and canvassing
• Charge your phone

CANVASSING TIPS

• Listen carefully to all instructions
• If a house or encounter with a constituent makes you feel uncomfortable for any reason, retreat, move on, and alert the local volunteer coordinator
