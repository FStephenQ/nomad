<p>Hi {{ rider.name }},</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the driver declined your request to join the carpool from {{ carpool.from_place }} to {{ carpool.destination.name }}, departing at {{ carpool.leave_time | humanize }}.</p>

<p>Please visit <a href="{{ url_for('carpool.find', _external=True) }}">{{ url_for('carpool.find', _external=True) }}</a> to look for another ride. We want you to get there!</p>

<p>P.S. If you're having trouble finding ride offers, make sure your local progressive organizations and party know about Nomad and are sending volunteers to share their carpools!</p>
