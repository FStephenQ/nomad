<p>Hi {{ rider['name'] }}!</p>

<p>Thank you for carpooling to canvass at [DESTINATION HERE!!!]. Your carpool's departure time is {{ carpool['leave_time'] | humanize }}, 
only two days away!</p>

<p>Make sure you have spoken to your driver to confirm your ride and settle all the details of pickup and drop-off. Your driver's info can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="{{ url_for('carpool.details', uuid=carpool['uuid'], _external=True) }}">Details about this carpool.</a></p>

<p>You can also use that link if you need to withdraw from the carpool. If you do withdraw, please try to do early enough 
  that other volunteers get a chance to join the carpool and the driver can make any changes they need to.</p>

<p>You are doing great work, thank you for getting a ride to canvass!</p>
