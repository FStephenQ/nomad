Hello {{ rider['name'] }},

Unfortunately, the carpool from {{ carpool['from_place'] }} to {{ carpool['to_place'] }} at {{ carpool['leave_time'] | humanize }} has been cancelled.

The driver gave the following reason for cancelling: {{ reason }}.

You can ask them at {{ driver['email'] }} if they're willing to reschedule, or go to {{url_for('carpool.find', _external=True)}} to look for another ride.

Thank you for your enthusiasm!
